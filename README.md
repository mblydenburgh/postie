# Postie - a Postman alternative

Postie is very much heavily in development but here are some it's early goals:
- Be a free, feature parity (to a basic extent) alternative to Postman.
Mainly started due to a need at work, where Postman cloud accounts are not allowed.
- A basic extent means: making requests, saving request history, and being able to 
save collections and environments.
- Have full interoperability with existing Postman file formats.
